# Automated-Email-Sender
This project aims at providing an automated email sender where you can specify the date and the person in file *Dates.csv*, you want to send the email and it will automatically send it.

---
## Dates.csv
In this file user can specify the name of the person he/she wants to send the mail, email of that person, month in which he/she wants to send the mail and then the date.

## emailTemplates
This folder contains the templates for the email in txt format. The code randomly chooses one of the templates to send the mail. 

Now no need to remember the dates😉, just once host this on a cloud and you are done😁.
